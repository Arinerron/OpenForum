# OpenForum
Open is an in-development simple, user-friendly forum software.  Created using PHP and MySQL.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have both MySQL and PHP5+ installed.
2. Either clone or download this repository.  Clone it directly from the site or use `git clone https://github.com/zacharyvincze/OpenForum`.
3. Import the database schematic into your database using phpMyAdmin, MySQLWorkbench or whatever you choose to use.  The schematic file is currently called `schema.sql` and should be updated with the server's newest additions.
4. Setup the configuration file.  Details about this will be in the setup section of the wiki.
5. Host the site in the document root, which is `public_html` by default.  I like to use PHP5's built in web server for this using `php -S localhost:8000`.  It's a nice quick way to get it hosted and check if it's up and running.

Congratulations, if you've gotten this far, you have successfully set up the site!
